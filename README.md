# Data coordination tools

This repository gathers existing tools used for data coordination at Sage, per
the metadata working group's 2019 objectives:

> (A) Create a GitHub repository containing:
> 
> - List of existing tools for data coordination converted, when applicable, to
> work with a common set of underlying schema standards (i.e. Schema.org and
> JSONSchemas) and documentation of the above tools. Tools should include at
> minimum
>   - tools for metadata schema definition
>   - tools for converting metadata schemas into validation schemas
>   - tools for validating metadata associated with new data uploaded to Synapse, 
>   based on metadata schema
>   - tools for validating existing metadata on Synapse
> - Gap analysis vis-a-vis existing data onboarding use-cases across Sage
> 
> (S) Document describing best practices across projects (aka how we will
> support data curation going forward)
